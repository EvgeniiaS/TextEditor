# TextEditor

Text editor application incorporates "intelligent" behaviour of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete,
flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. 

Other functionalities:
- Markov Text Generation, which generates text that resembles the source in a reasonable way. 

- Flesch Readability Score, which is a measure of the reading complexity of a piece of text. Developed by author Rudolf Flesch,
  it is a measure that approximates how easy a piece of text is to read based on the number of sentences, words and syllables in that text. 
  Higher scores indicate text that is simple to read, while lower scores indicate more complex text.
  
- Word Paths game, which tries to find a path from one word to another with the restriction that it can only make one change
  at a time (letter permutation, letter insertion, letter deletion) and that whatever change it makes, it has to result in a real word.
  
  The front-end code is developed by US San Diego Programming MOOC team (source: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance).
